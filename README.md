# EncryptedConfigEditor
EncryptedConfigEditor is a Windows Forms application designed to edit encrypted sections of a `.config` file. It provides a user-friendly interface to load, edit, and save configuration files, ensuring that sensitive sections are properly encrypted. This project was created as an alternative to the `aspnet_regiis` command line utility.
